# PyDAL reference

# NOTE

You've found a hidden file. This is more of a todo list and a set of aspirations than concrete plans for a PyDAL reference.
I would love to do a PyDAL reference but its a huge job. At the moment I'm just collecting notes on what it should cover

* IS_IN_SET has lots of interesting features found in Chapter 7 of the 
[web2py docs](http://www.web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/07/forms-and-validators?search=is_in_set),
such as custom error messges and `zero`.
