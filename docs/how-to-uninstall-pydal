# How to uninstall PyDAL

Some problems have been reported updating PyDAL and removing earlier versions is sometimes necessary--possibly more than once.
You may need to uninstall earlier versions explicitly. For example:

## To uninstall earlier versions of PyDAL

Suppose you want the newest version of PyDAL and wish to avoid version conflicts. 
Depending on how long you've been using it, you may need to run commands like this (obviously the versions you used may differ):

```
:: Windows users can omit the sudo
sudo python3.6 -m pip uninstall pydal
sudo python3.7 -m pip uninstall pydal
sudo python3.8 -m pip uninstall pydal
```

You may need to do this twice. Python3 appears not to get this right every time, a phenomenon not observedw with Python 2.x.

## To install a specific version

Then to install a particular version of PyDAL, for example the one for Python 3.8, use `pip` as expected:

```
python3.8 -m pip install -U pydal
```
